Start the process of removing your RF shield. It's okay. You will not hurt anything and you will need to do this to get it out of the way.

I use heat to remove the jewel. This is a somewhat hazardous process and I recommend you research every mothod out there to remove your jewel.

Go ahead and drill a hole in your lid and then extend that hole to the inner-most ring. Please do not extend the cut any further than shown in the second photo. It is not necessary and this wider lip will need to remain in the future.

Go ahead and plug the 3P included JST cable into your BSX modchip. If you do not have a BSX chip, but you are cool enough to buy this Jewel anyway, there are alternate solder points on teh rear, which will show through

You can either leave the foam, or remove it and grind down the two fins on the left and right, however, there are some 0402 components that will need space in order for the Jewel to sit flat, so please do not grind them down all the way. You will have a tweaked jewel, bro.

Go ahead and run the wire up through the middle and then up through the hole in the shell of your case. Then, plug the JST cable into the "PWR In" socket of the Jewel.

Then, use your own method for gluing in your jewel. However you do it, please make sure that your jewel is aligned and straight before the glue dries.
